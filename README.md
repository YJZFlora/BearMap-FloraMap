# BearMap-FloraMap
Web mapping application of UCB area.

The userâ€™s web browser provides a URL to the Java program, and the back end Java program will take this URL and generate the appropriate output, which will displayed in the browser.

**Functions I achieved:**

- Zoom in and zoom out.
- Find the route between two places
- Autocomplete and Search

**Technology I used:**

Java

- Provide rastering images when user zoom in or zoom out.
- Calculate the shortest path.
- Implement an Autocomplete system where a user types in a partial query string.
- Implement the method to draw red dot markers on each of the matching locations.
